SliTaz Drag N' Drop tool
================================================================================


TazDrop is a small window which can run in a corner of a screen and as an 
expanded panel and let you Drag N' Drop any kind of content and perform an 
action on it. If you drop an URL to a site it will open a browser to its 
location, if the URL is a file (tarball, ISO, PDF, etc) it will download it. 
It can also handle email addresses, SliTaz Packages (drop one on TazDrop and 
it will install it) and if you drop a folder it will create a tar.bz2 archive 
of it. You can even drop one of its options, try to drop: --notes

Note: This tool is separate from tazboxes since it runs permanently and has
quite a few lines of code.


Auto start the DND window
-------------------------
To start TazDrop with your Window manager you have to put these lines in your
autostart script (For Openbox: ~/.config/openbox/autostart) to have a DND
window with some text:

# TazDrop Drag N' Drop handler
tazdrop --dnd &

To use an image as DND box, you can configure the image path via tazdrop.conf:

# TazDrop Drag N' Drop handler
tazdrop --dnd-image &


Misc notes
----------

	* Dropped folders will be archived to tar.bz2
	* Text content is written to $HOME/.cache/tazdrop.notes
	* Applications are logically configurable as well as the tool
	  behaviour
