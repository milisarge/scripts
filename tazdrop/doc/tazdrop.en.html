<h2>SliTaz Drag N' Drop tool</h2>

<p>TazDrop is a small window which can run in a corner of a screen and as an 
expanded panel and lets you Drag N' Drop any kind of content and perform an 
action on it. If you drop a URL to a site it will open a browser to its 
location, if the URL is a file (ie. tarball, ISO, PDF, etc) it will download it. 
It can also handle email addresses and SliTaz Packages (drop one on TazDrop and 
it will install it) and if you drop a folder it will create a tar.bz2 archive 
of it. You can even drop one of its options, try to drop: <tt>--notes</tt></p>

<p><b>Note:</b> This tool is separate from tazboxes since it runs permanently
and has quite a few lines of code.</p>


<h2>Auto start the DND window</h2>

<p>To start TazDrop with your Window manager you have to put these lines in your
autostart script (For Openbox: <tt>~/.config/openbox/autostart</tt>) to have
a DND window with some text:</p>

<pre>
# TazDrop Drag N' Drop handler
tazdrop --dnd &amp;
</pre>

<p>To use an image as a DND box you can configure the image path via
<tt>tazdrop.conf</tt>:</p>

<pre>
# TazDrop Drag N' Drop handler
tazdrop --dnd-image &amp;
</pre>


<h2>Misc notes</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Dropped folders will be archived to tar.bz2</li>
	<li>Text content is written to <tt>$HOME/.cache/tazdrop.notes</tt></li>
	<li>Applications are logically configurable as well as the tool behaviour</li>
</ul>
